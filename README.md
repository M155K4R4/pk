knitic-2D-yarn-rendering
========================

Simple 2D yarn visualization rendering. The tool can import images and export as yarn visualizations.
This project is part of the research on the knitic project(open hardware knitting machine):http://knitic.com

The code is made using Processing 2.

Render functionalities:
* export in png and pdf(vectorial)
* transparent background or fill with color
* Sliders to control realtime yarn thickness and stitch size   

Dependency libraries:
* controlP5
